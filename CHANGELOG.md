## 2026-06-10 — Alyssa

**Files changed:**
- `.env.local` (VPS only — not committed)
- Supabase staging: `shared` schema, `shared.app_roles` table

**Changes:**
- Discovered staging Supabase (`qjqkpockmujecjgmdple`) was created fresh by Gustav today with no user profiles configured
- Fixed `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env.local` on VPS — was pointing to production project key, now correctly set to staging
- Exposed `shared` schema in Supabase staging API settings (Project Settings → API → Exposed schemas)
- Created `shared.app_roles` table with `user_id UNIQUE` constraint
- Added user roles: Alyssa Krishna (`senior_developer` / IT), Gustav (`quality_default` / Quality — Quality module only)
- Restarted PM2 with updated environment

## 2026-06-10 — Gustav

**Files changed:**
- `app/(app)/quality/sieving/page.tsx`
- `scripts/restart-staging.sh` (new)
- `QUALITY_MIGRATION_NOTES.md` (new)
- Supabase staging: `qms` schema permissions + data migration

**Changes:**
- Fixed `data_json` parsing for PA/R-grade lookups in sieving lot auto-fill
- Fixed `lookupLot()` to fire PA/R fill even when no prior sieving runs exist for the lot
- Fixed double-space typo in `calcPercents` that broke gram → percent calculation
- Fixed spec editor: editable Grade name, always-visible mesh inputs, delete row button, PA auto-fill always fires on save
- Granted `SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` on all `qms` tables to `authenticated` role in staging Supabase
- Migrated ~375 PA/TA records and ~250 residue records from production into `qms.quality_records` on staging
- Added R-grade (residue) lookup alongside PA level — auto-fills both in lot message, e.g. `PA: P1 · R: R-0`
